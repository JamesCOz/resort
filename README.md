# Website Mock-Up for Investor

### by Alan Falcon, Michael Arrington, James Osborn

## Description

As requested, here are multiple versions of your tropical island resort website. The master branch is very basic without much markup. The paradise branch shows your resort in a very flattering light, while the prison branch shows the resort more realistically. Please let us know which style you prefer, and we will push that website to GitHub.

## Installation/Minimum Requirements
